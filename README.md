# DSEngine

WebGL based 3D ARPG engine based on the old (Darkstone)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkstone] game. For testing, I'm using graphics from (Quaternius)[https://www.patreon.com/quaternius], but at some point in the future this will be integrated with my (Darkstone recreation project)[https://github.com/Game3DEE/darkstone] to load the Darkstone game data directly.

For now I'm focusing on gameplay, and level / room creation. I am planning to add non-fantasy tilesets (from both (Quaternius)[https://www.patreon.com/quaternius] and (Kenny)[https://kenney.nl/]) in the near future too.

Stay tuned, and feel free to leave feedback.

There is a Github hosted (live demo)[https://game3dee.github.io/dsengine/] available.
